  abstract = {Spatiotemporal disorder has been recently associated to the occurrence of anomalous nonergodic diffusion of molecular components in biological systems, but the underlying microscopic mechanism is still unclear. We introduce a model in which a particle performs continuous Brownian motion with changes of diffusion coefficients induced by transient molecular interactions with diffusive binding partners. In spite of the exponential distribution of waiting times, the model shows subdiffusion and nonergodicity similar to the heavy-tailed continuous time random walk. The dependence of these properties on the density of binding partners is analyzed and discussed. Our work provide an experimentally-testable microscopic model to investigate the nature of nonergodicity in disordered media.},

  abstract = {We introduce a model, in which a particle performs a continuous time random walk (CTRW) coupled to an environment with Ising dynamics. The particle shows locally varying diffusivity determined by the geometrical properties of the underlying Ising environment, that is, the diffusivity depends on the size of the connected area of spins pointing in the same direction. The model shows anomalous diffusion when the Ising environment is at critical temperature. We show that any finite scale introduced by a temperature different from the critical one, or a finite size of the environment, cause subdiffusion only during a transient time. The characteristic time, at which the system returns to normal diffusion after the subdiffusive plateau depends on the limiting scale and on how close the temperature is to criticality. The system also displays apparent ergodicity breaking at intermediate time, while ergodicity breaking at longer time occurs only under the idealized infinite environment at the critical temperature.},

  abstract = { We study the random walk of a particle in a compartmentalized environment, as realized in biological samples or solid state compounds. Each compartment is characterized by its length L and the boundaries transmittance T. We identify two relevant spatio-temporal scales that provide alternative descriptions of the dynamics: i) the microscale, in which the particle position is monitored at constant time intervals; and ii) the mesoscale, in which it is monitored only when the particle crosses a boundary between compartments. Both descriptions provide --by construction-- the same long time behavior. The analytical description obtained at the proposed mesoscale allows for a complete characterization of the complex movement at the microscale, thus representing a fruitful approach for this kind of systems. We show that the presence of disorder in the transmittances is a necessary condition to induce anomalous diffusion, whereas the spatial heterogeneity reduces the degree of subdiffusion and, in some cases, can even compensate for the disorder induced by the stochastic transmittance.},

  abstract = {In order to study transport in complex environments, it is extremely important to determine the physical mechanism underlying diffusion, and precisely characterize its nature and parameters. Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate even very short trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with a high accuracy. In addition, the method is able to classify the motion according to normal or anomalous diffusion, and determine its anomalous exponent with a small error. The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/testing dataset. This allows for a full, high-accuracy characterization of experimental trajectories without the need of any prior information. },

  abstract = {Phase separation is emerging as key principle in the spatiotemporal organization of living cells. Given its relevance in the regulation of numerous biological functions, including gene transcription and chromatin architecture, modeling biomolecular condensation is gaining interest. Yet, most models developed so far rely on specific descriptions and/or experimentally inaccessible properties. Here we propose a theoretical model, where phase separation is explained by means of interaction probabilities between particles. With minimum model requirements, particle condensates emerge above a critical interaction probability. We tested the model predictions with single molecule experiments of tunable transcription factor condensates in the nucleus of living cells. Phase separation, condensate sizes, diffusion behavior, and mobility parameters, quantified by data analysis and machine learning, are fully recapitulated by our model. Our combined theoretical and experimental approach provides a general framework to investigate the biophysical parameters controlling phase separation in living cells and in other soft matter-based interacting systems.},

  abstract = {Deviations from Brownian motion leading to anomalous diffusion are ubiquitously found in transport dynamics, playing a crucial role in phenomena from quantum physics to life sciences. The detection and characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory are challenging tasks, which traditionally rely on calculating the mean squared displacement of the trajectory. However, this approach breaks down for cases of important practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, ensembles of heterogeneous trajectories, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams independently applied their own algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, providing practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers. },

  abstract = {Computationally intractable tasks are often encountered in physics and optimization. Such tasks often comprise a cost function to be optimized over a so-called feasible set, which is specified by a set of constraints. This may yield, in general, to difficult and non-convex optimization tasks. A number of standard methods are used to tackle such problems: variational approaches focus on parameterizing a subclass of solutions within the feasible set; in contrast, relaxation techniques have been proposed to approximate it from outside, thus complementing the variational approach by providing ultimate bounds to the global optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel approach combining the power of relaxation techniques with deep reinforcement learning in order to find the best possible bounds within a limited computational budget. We illustrate the viability of the method in the context of finding the ground state energy of many-body quantum systems, a paradigmatic problem in quantum physics. We benchmark our approach against other classical optimization algorithms such as breadth-first search or Monte-Carlo, and we characterize the effect of transfer learning. We find the latter may be indicative of phase transitions, with a completely autonomous approach. Finally, we provide tools to generalize the approach to other common applications in the field of quantum information processing.},

Our results indicate that the standard initialization of Boltzmann machines with random weights equivalent to spin-glass models is an unnecessary bottleneck in the process of training. Furthermore, this new family allows for very easy access to low-energy configurations, which points to new, efficient training algorithms. The simplest variant of such algorithms approximates the negative phase of the log-likelihood gradient with no Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling costs at all, and with an accuracy sufficient to achieve good learning and generalization.},

Polaron superdiffuses if it couples in the same manner to both components, i.e. either attractively or repulsively to both of them. This is the same behavior as that of an impurity immersed in a single BEC. Conversely, the polaron exhibits a transient nontrivial subdiffusive behavior if it couples attractively to one of the components and repulsively to the other. The anomalous diffusion exponent and the duration of the subdiffusive interval can be controlled with the Rabi frequency of the coherent coupling between the two components, and with the coupling strength of the impurity to the BEC.},
