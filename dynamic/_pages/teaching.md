### Characterization of Ergodicity Breaking and Anomalous Diffusion from Single Trajectories
*2021, University of Gothenburg, Virtual (Sweden)*

This lectures were given by Dr. Carlo Manzo during the workshop <a href = "http://active-matter.eu/events/initial-training-on-experimental-methods-for-active-matter/" > Initial Training on Experimental Methods for Active Matter </a>. I collaborated in both in the development of the lectures content as well as in the exercises part. You can find the latter, with a throughout explanation on simulations of anomalous diffusion in <a href= "https://github.com/AnDiChallenge/first_steps_in_anomalous_diffusion" > in this repository </a>.

### Python Bootcamp BIST Master
*2020, BIST, Virtual, Barcelona (Spain)*

Together with <a href="https://twitter.com/BorjaRequena" > Borja Requena </a> (mainly him!), gave a introduction to Python for the <a href = "https://mmres.bist.eu/" > Master of
Multidisciplinary Research in Experimental Sciences </a>, organized by the <a href = "https://bist.eu/" > Barcelona Insitute of Science and Technology (BIST) </a>. All the contents of the course can be found in <a href = "https://github.com/gorkamunoz/BIST-master-python-bootcamp"> this Github repo! </a>

### Machine learning in quantum and classical data
*2018 and 2019, UPC, Barcelona (Spain)*

Co-lectured a course on quantum and classical machine learning for the <a href = "https://photonics.masters.upc.edu/es" > Master in Photonics (UPC-UAB-UB-ICFO) </a>. My lectures focused on Reinforcement Learning techniques. The slides and exercises of my part of the course can be found <a href = "https://github.com/gorkamunoz/QML-Course-UPC-2019" > here </a>, as well as the content on lectures about general machine learning and Boltzmann machines.

### Quantum Machine Learning Workshop
*2019, ICFO, Barcelona (Spain)*

Co-organized a practical session on Quantum Machine learning with Qiskit as part of the program of the <a href = "https://www.icfo.es/calendar2?event=4386"> Corporate Liason day 2019 at ICFO </a>. We explained how easy it is to implement the quantum support vector machine. <a href = "https://github.com/gorkamunoz/QSVM-Introduction" > Here </a> you will find the content of the course.

### Quantum Programming with IBM Qiskit
*2019, Thinktic, Logro√±o (Spain)*

Organized and taught an extended course (18 hours) on quantum machine learning implemented on the IBM library, Qiskit. The course is aimed to people with little to no knowledge on quantum physics covering the basics of Machine Learning and Quantum Physics as well as their implementation on IBM quantum computers.

### BIST Internatiotional Youth Summer Bootcamp
*2019, BIST, Barcelona (Spain)*

Participated as an organizer and teacher of the ICFO branch of the <a href = "https://biysc.org/" > BIYSC </a>, a two weeks summer camp for outstanding highschool students. In particular, I helped to organize the whole program and imparted lectures on simulations of quantum criptography algorithms. <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uChWqEyQAHIqrCpR5d1IyGA8dXkFaMKC/view?usp=sharing" > Here </a> is the notebook that I used to introduce how simulations can be used to study physics and <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CNgz2V12J7d70UfEIMlNlhm3QIG-6uE6?usp=sharing" > here </a> you will the exercise I developed to understand the BB84 criptographic algorithm.
